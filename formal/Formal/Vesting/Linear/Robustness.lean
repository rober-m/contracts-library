Linear vesting — ROBUSTNESS: explicit rejection theorems (spec §9 R-clauses,
§5.1). The validator REJECTS malformed/malicious spends. These complement
Soundness: soundness says "if accepted, then good"; robustness names specific
bad transactions and proves they are *not* accepted.

The headline one is no-double-satisfaction (§5.1, I2): two contract inputs
sharing a datum cannot be satisfied by a single continuation; the `k`-scaling
rule forces `k × required`.

/-- **R3, concrete: tampered continuation datum ⇒ reject.** The honest claim of
`claim_accept_concrete`, but the continuation carries a datum `outDatum` that
differs from the input's. The validator recognizes a continuation only when its
datum is byte-identical to the input's, so the lone output is not counted, the
required remainder (50) is not preserved, and the claim is rejected (spec §9 R3,
I3). `outDatum ≠ datumData dConcrete` is the load-bearing inequality. -/

/-- **R4 — datum-hash input is rejected (spec §3.1).** The honest claim, but the
contract input carries a datum *hash* instead of an inline datum (the resolved
datum is still supplied via the script info). The validator requires an inline
datum on its input, so the spend is rejected regardless of the (valid) hash. -/

credential, with **no** withdrawal keyed by it (and no signature), is not

/-- **R6, concrete: premature cancel ⇒ reject.** A `Cancel` by the (authorized)
locker at any `now ≤ recovery_time` (3000) is rejected: the validator requires
the validity range to be *strictly* after `recovery_time`, so a too-early cancel
fails (spec §9 R6, §4.3). The locker is signed and the schedule is well-formed,
so timing is the only reason for rejection. `now ≤ 3000` is load-bearing.

path, which reads no outputs.) -/

`recovery_time` (so timing is fine, `3000 < now`) but with the locker credential
**unsatisfied** (no signatory) is rejected. The dual of `cancel_complete`:
together they isolate locker auth as the deciding factor on the cancel path. -/

/-- **No double satisfaction (spec §5.1, I2).** Two contract inputs sharing a
byte-identical datum, with a single continuation holding only `1 × required`
(50 at `now = 1500`), is rejected: invoked for the first input, the validator
computes `k = 2` and requires `2 × required` (100), which the lone 50-output
fails to meet. So one shared continuation cannot satisfy two inputs; an attacker
cannot pocket the duplicate. Contrast `claim_accept_two_inputs`, where the same
two inputs with a `2 × required` continuation are accepted. -/
